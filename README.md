# machine_learning

Non-exhaustive Machine Learning project I worked on 

1- Classification : The aim of this project was to implement different classification methods such as Logistic regression, LDA, SVM, ...

2- Clustering : The aim of this project was to implement different clustering methods such as K-Means, Agglomerative clustering, DBSCAN, ...

3- Dimension_reduction :  The aim of this project was to implement two dimension reduction methods : PCA, T-SNE.

4- GMM :  The aim of this project was to work on Gaussian Mixture Models.

5- MOS :  The aim of this project was to work on Model Order Selection by using AIC and BIC.

6- NMF :  The aim of this project was to implement a Non-negative Matrix Factorization.

7- Regression :  The aim of this project was to implement different regression methods such as Linear Regression, Basis Function Regression and Robust Regression by using different Regularization terms.
